# ZNP-Python
Some rough code to work with Zigbee ZNP on TI CC2530, esp for use with Zigbee2MQTT. WIP (and part of a learning experience!)

A write-up of the exploration of ZNP with Zigbee2MQTT is [on my blog](https://www.hilltop-cottage.info/blogs/adam/using-z-stack-znp-to-make-diy-zigbee-devices-to-work-with-zigbee2mqtt/).
